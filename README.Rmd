# fable.binary
<!-- badges: start -->

The R package *fable.binary* provides a collection of time series forecasting models suitable for binary time series. These models work within the fable framework, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/robjhyndman/fable.binary)

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("robjhyndman/fable.binary")
```

## Examples

```{r example, echo = TRUE}
fit <- melb_rain |>
  model(
    nn = BINNET(Wet ~ fourier(K = 2, period = "year")),
    logistic = LOGISTIC(Wet ~ fourier(K = 2, period = "year"))
  )
fit |> tidy()
fit |> select(logistic) |> glance()
fit |> select(logistic) |> report()
fit |> select(nn) |> glance()
fit |> select(nn) |> report()
augment(fit)
```
